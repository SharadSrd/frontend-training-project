	<h3>Subject of Study</h3>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility
     â€” as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.
      You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person 
      we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
       intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:


	<ol>
		<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine ie C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub></li>
		<li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> </li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Exotic Dance Moves</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>Break</dt>
		  <dd>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic
               tribal  dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as 
               follows, with definitions:

            </dd>
		  <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
		    <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a
                 whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage 
                 their livestock to be "fruitful".
                </dd>
		  <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
		    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the
                 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized 
                 by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of 
                 Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that 
                 they were just moving like this because they were really cold.
